## Step by Step

### the mussels
Cook the mussels in the fresh herbs with one glass of wine per 3kg (6lbs). Don't overcook them! A little underdone is fine as they'll cook a little more in the sauce afterwards. When they are all cooked, get them out and filter the juice.

### the sauce
Dice the shallots and onions really fine and color them lightly in the butter. Add the crushed garlic, the flour, and the juice, and start thickening your sauce on a small heat for about 10 minutes. In a separate pan, whisk the egg yolks with the cream and warm up gently. Do NOT cook this!

Take everything off of the fire, add the cream with the sauce, and a big tablespoon of curry powder. Taste and season with some extra crushed black pepper. Now add al the mussels and 1 cup of chopped parsley

### Optional
you can serve this as is for an appetizer or as a full meal with some toasted bread. One alternative of serving is grilled in a fireproof casserole with some gruyere cheese on top.

This recipe has some French roots but has been honed down over time by my father Freddy De Leenheer. It is by far the most 'different' type of dish anyone has ever eaten and has brought many people joy in life when we serve it to them. The thickness of the creamy sauce with the abundance of good mussels is truly a treat!
