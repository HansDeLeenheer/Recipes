* In the mean time do the same prep for the eggplant and courgette.
* Tip: I quarter each slice of eggplant and courgette so this eats easily with just a fork or spoon.
* Divide in equal parts over all the portions and press down with a spoon.
* Put it bak in the oven for another 20 minutes.

* In the mean time we make the meat sauce.
* First fry the onion until golden and soft.
* Add the minced meat and keep frying until aal the moisture is gone and the meat starts to brown and crips up a bit.

* Put aside the meat while we make a bechamel sauce
* Mix the flour with the cold butter (I use a food processor) until you get a paste.
* Heat up the milk. Once the milk is boiling turn off the heat and add the butter/flour paste (the roux). Once the roux is well melted, cook gently while stirring for another 3-5 minutes.
* Season well with black pepper and ground nutmeg.

* Once the veggies come out of the oven, first add a layer of the meat sauce and then a layer of bechamel. I like to use the back of a spoon t gently create a smooth surface.
* Finish with a layer of grated parmesan.

* Put it bak in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until you get a golden crust
* Alternative: don't put it back in the oven but instead put it in the freezer or fridge for later! Just make sure it's properly thawed and reheat for those same 20-25 minutes in a 350F oven or until you get that nice golden crust.
