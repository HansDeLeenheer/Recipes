# Bloodsausage
## Short Description
A lot of cultures have blood sausages in their repertoire. Whether it's called 'blackpudding' in the UK, 'morcilla' in Spain and Mexico, 'boudin' for the French,  or 'beuling' in my neighborhood (Flanders, BE), it all boils down (ba-dum tsjing) to mostly pigs blood with a starch thickener like rice or old bread in a sausage casing, cooked 'till firm and then grilled. In Belgium, we serve it with warm apple sauce by the way!

## Time & Materials
About 1.5 hours (plus 2 to 3 hours if you're boiling your own pig's heads - recommended!)
* Hog casings 34mm (1.3 inches)
* large casserole and preferably sous vide (optional but very handy)
* sausage stuffer, or alternatively a plastic funnel would work also since this is a quite liquid sausage in the making
* meat grinder

## Ingredients
| Ingredients | Metric | Imperial |
|----------|-------------:|------:|
| pigs blood | 5 L | 10 pints |
| yellow onion | 5 kg | 10 lbs |
| neck fat | 2 kg | 4 lbs |
| backfat | 2 kg | 4 lbs |
| head meat (or just 2 heads) | 1 kg | 2 lbs |
| chunky apple sauce | 1 kg | 2 lbs |
| cane sugar | | 1 cup |
| black pepper | | 1/2 cup |
| salt | | 1/2 cup |
| ground cloves | | 2 TB |
| ground pigment | | 2 TB |
| ground nutmeg | | 1 TB |
| breadcrumbs* | 1 kg | 2 lbs |

\* the original recipe did not include breadcrumbs but I do recommend it, especially for your first time.

## Step by Step
Boil the pig's heads in a court bouillon (carrots, onion, celery, bay leaves, peppercorns, salt) for two to three hours until it almost falls apart. Remove the bones, eyes, ear glands, and cartilage from the ears. Mix with the fats and pass it through a course grinder setting once.

Bring the blood to body temperature (37C, 98F) and mix in all the other ingredients until you get a homogeneous mass. Immediately start filling your casings as the blood will start to thicken if you wait too long. ProTip: clean your casings the day ahead in water with a dash of vinegar.

Bring the water in your large casserole (with or without sous vide) up to 80C / 175F and cook your sausages for about 15 to 30 minutes until they no longer leak when poked with a skewer.
