| **TOTAAL** || **€00.00** |

This makes 9 portions, 6 with bacon, 3 without (veggie)

## Preparation
* Fry/cook the bacon lardons in a pan and put aside for later. Don;t go burnt crispy! We want them still soft.
* Cook the macaroni. Al dente is fine as it will cook slightly further in the oven later.

### Cheese sauce
* Mix the flour with the cold butter (I use a food processor) until you get a paste.
* Heat up the milk. Once the milk is boiling turn off the heat and add the butter/flour paste (the roux). Once the roux is well melted, cook gently while stirring for another 3-5 minutes.
* Season well with black pepper and ground nutmeg.
* Add the Emmenthal cheese. Your cheese sauce is ready

### Bring it together
* Add the sauce over your macaroni (or the other way around).
* If you want to make some veggie portion, this is your time to make them.
* Otherwise throw in your bacon lardons and mix well together with a big spoon.

* Divide in equal portions (or one big pot).
* Add the grated gratin cheese and after that srpinkle a big TB of breadcrumbs over each portion.
* Cover, put in the fridge for later or in the freezer for later-later.

## Serve
* Get the MacNCheese out of the freezer one day ahead and put it in the fridge to thaw.
* Preheat the over at 350F and cook for a good 20 minutes until you get a golden crust. Bon Apetit!
