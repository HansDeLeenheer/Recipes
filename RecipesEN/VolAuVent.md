## Bereiding
* Cut the carrots, onion, and celery into large chunks. You only need these for making your own chicken stock.
* Slice your mushrooms and halve them if necessary.

* Put all the aromats at the bottom of your pot and place the chickens on top. Fill the pot with water until they are properly submerged.
* You can add some dried herbs, some pepper corn, and two bay leaves.
* Bring slowly to a boil and let this simmer for about 90 minutes.

* In the meantime we got all the time in the world to prepare some meatballs.
* Bring together the minced meat with an egg, a handful of breadcrumbs, some soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, and some Mediterranean spices if you will.
* Now roll this mince in small meatballs, no larger than 2/3 inch.

* After 90 minutes get the chicken out of the stock, let cool down for 5 minutes until you can pull the meat off of the carcass, and put it aside for a minute. 
* Add the carcass back to to pot and let the stock simmer gently for another two hours.

* Now tear the meat of the chickens in bite-size chunks. Not too small, but also not that you should cut it before eating. Please don't make pulled chicken here :-) 
* Set aside (in the fridge) for later.

* Now we'll prepare the mushrooms. We're going to gently prepare these in a frying pan. Throw the mushrooms in a cold pan with a dash of water (I know, trust me) and now turn on the heat, cook until all the water has come out of the mushrooms and is evaporated.

* Once all the water is gone add a splash of oil and we cook them lightly browned.
* Season with salt and pepper and 2 minced cloves of garlic.
* Put aside until the very end.

* Since we are working with a hot tock, we need to use a cold roux as a binder.
* Mix the flour with the cold butter (I use a food processor) until you get a paste and put aside until the stock is ready.

* Once the stock is ready to go, filter it through a cheesecloth and keep 4 pints.
* Bring it to a boil and throw in the meatballs one by one, cook them until they float, and then get them out of the pot.

* Make sure the stock is on a slow rolling boil and add the cold roux paste in chunks. Now stir properly with a whisk and boil gently for a good 5 minutes until the sauce is thickened.
* Now it's time to add the cream.

* Your sauce is now ready. Season to taste with salt and pepper and maybe a pinch of nutmeg. Add the pieces of chicken and meatballs and heat everything through for serving or saving.

## Serve
* Optional: it is very common to add a good handful of chopped flat-leaf parsley at the end for color and a little freshness.
