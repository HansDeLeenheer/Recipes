* Make sure the cubes are well dissolved and bouil the soup for 5 minutes.
* Mix the soup really, really well. If you have a big blender, use that! Optionally, people who don't like the mouthfeel of mixed mushrooms can strain the soup through a cheesecloth.
* Now add the heavy cream and season to taste.
