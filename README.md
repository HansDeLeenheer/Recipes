# Recipes

Welcome to my place of happiness. There are two reasons food has taken a central part of my life. First of all, I truly enjoy eating and sharing my feelings about good food. This goes from a hotdog food cart to 3-star Michelin restaurants. One time on a business trip in the US alone, I had one single small four-ingredient dish that was so good, I cried because I couldn't share that experience.

The second reason is the saying "The love of man goes through their stomach". And I'm using "man" here for mankind in general. Originally it was an antiquated way of saying that a woman can get a lot of love from her man by cooking for him with love. But I truly think that counts for all humans alike. Cooking with love for someone else, and receiving good food cooked with love for you, is one of the greatest joys in life. This is one of the reasons I truly love how in English we use the word "Hospitality" for the branch of work that is about serving others with shelter and food.

I've struggled a lot with how to keep track of all my recipes over time. I've had them in Evernote, on Google Drive in Docs, and just everywhere spread around. The hardest part about recipes is when you want to share them publicly and have them evolve over time. What I learned from working in software is that Github is *the way* for this kind of information sharing. So here it goes. All I've learned and gathered and adapted over time. For you to take home and test for yourselves. For in the end, none of these recipes were truly original. We're all standing on the shoulders of the giants before us!

Feel free to comment, and add your own changes. And if you don't know how to use Github, feel free to send me a note on [my email](mailto:hansdeleenheer@gmail.com)
